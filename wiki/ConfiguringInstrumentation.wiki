#summary Instructions on how to configure Salve's bytecode postprocessing

== Java5+ JVM Agent ==
=== When ===
Best option for development as no special code post-compilation step is needed, making launching the application directly from an IDE easy.
=== How ===
To enable the agent add the following JVM option to the startup command:
{{{
-Djavaagent:<path to salve-agent.jar>
}}}

Example:
{{{
java ... -Djavaagent:~/.m2/repository/salve/salve-agent/1.0/salve-agent-1.0.jar
}}}
